# Duck Night
It's a duck night.
Ducks are in danger tonight.

"We're being surrounded! Get up and... oh, you can't"

"Well, give me a hand then... oh, you can't either"

You are a limbless, crippled duck.
Looking at you, I feel good knowing I'm not you.

"I think we know what you have to do"

"Put this gun in your mouth and try to shoot something!"

# Game analysis
Bullethell Luftrauser-like where you control a limbless duck.
The first round you are laying in the ground, with a gun in your mouth that aims almost randomly and you can barely move.

Playing rounds you gain points to buy upgrades, like bionic limbs, weapons and things to place in the map.
The longer you stay alive, the harder the game gets, untill you die, upgrade and try again.
